Windows Fundamentals 1:

New Technology File System or simply - NTFS
-------------------------------------------

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System)

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

-Supports files larger than 4GB
-Set specific permissions on folders and files
-Folder and file compression
-Encryption ( Encryption File System or EFS )


On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.
The permissions are:

-Full control
-Modify
-Read & Execute
-List folder contents
-Read
-Write
