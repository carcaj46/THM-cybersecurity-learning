PT 1:

Command/Description
-------------------
echo	Output any text that we provide
whoami	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!


ls	listing
cd	change directory
cat	concatenate, display content of file
pwd	print working directory
find 	syntax, -name passwords.txt 	//specific
		-name *.txt		//any file of type
grep 	search the contents in files	syntax, grep "81.143.211.90" access.log
wc	count number of entries


Shell Operators
---------------

Symbol Operator/Description
---------------------------

&		This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&		This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
>		This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>		This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).



PT 2:

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form.

e.g., 	ssh tryhackme@10.80.164.116

Flags and Switches
------------------

//Using our ls example, ls informs us that there is only one folder named "folder1" as highlighted in the screenshot below. Note that the contents in the screenshots below are only examples.
//However, after using the -a argument (short for --all), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as ".hiddenfolder". Files and folders with "." are hidden files.


--help	This option will list the possible options that the command accepts


!! https://linux.die.net/man/ !! Linux manual

man 	To access this documentation e.g., //tryhackme@linux2:~$ man ls\


Command	Full Name	Purpose
-------------------------------

touch	touch		Create file
mkdir	make directory	Create a folder
cp	copy		Copy a file or folder
mv	move		Move a file or folder
rm	remove		Remove a file or folder
file	file		Determine the type of a file


Permissions
-----------

//Permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.


su	switch user
-l	--login, switch


e.g., 	ls -l /path/to/file


THM e.g.
--------

Using su to switch to user2 interactively:

tryhackme@linux2:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$
For example, when using su to switch to "user2", our new session drops us into our previous user's home directory. 

Using su to switch to user2 interactively:

tryhackme@linux2:~$ su -l user2
Password:
user2@linux2:~$ pwd
user2@:/home/user2$

Where now, after using -l, our new session has dropped us into the home directory of "user" automatically. 


Common Directories
------------------

/etc	etcetc			location to store system files used by os
/var	variable data		root folders on Linux install 
/root	root for system user	user would have their data in a directory such as "/home/root" by default.  
/tmp	temporary		stores volatile data
